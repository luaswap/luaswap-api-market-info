# LuaSwap API

The LuaSwap API is a set of endpoints used by market aggregators (e.g. coinmarketcap.com) to surface 
LuaSwap liquidity and volume information. All information is fetched from the underlying subgraphs.

Prefer the LuaSwap subgraph for any Uniswap queries whenever possible. The respective subgraphs will always have more
recent data.
